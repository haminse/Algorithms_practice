                <h1><strong>WEST COAST</strong></h1>
                I've been dreamin' 'bout the West Coast (I've been dreamin')
                Found some faces that I don't know (I've been dreamin' about it)
                Give me the sun for just a year
                I'll kiss the sky and disappear
                I've been starin' up at the greyest skies
                Tryin' to find myself some luck, but it's runnin' dry
                It's like the weather makes the worst of my cloudy mind
                I could really use a dose of some paradise
                Sometimes you gotta run from a broken heart
                Before I turn into a ghost, need a brand new start
                Get myself headed to the coast, man, it ain't that far
                Yeah, they got sun in LA and some shinin' stars
                I've been dreamin' 'bout the West Coast (I've been dreamin')
                Found some faces that I don't know (I've been dreamin' about it)
                I'm seein' signs for California
                Trade the shade for somethin' warmer
                I've been dreamin' 'bout the West Coast (I've been dreamin')
                Where the people take it real slow (I've been dreamin' about it)
                I need the sun for just a year
                I'll kiss the sky and disappear
                Ain't felt a drop now for forty days
                But still they're washing cars and they don't show any age
                Ain't nothin' that you want'll cost you more than time
                If you're tryna find yourself, better get in line
                I'm countin' up my money and spendin' to get it right
                Got the future in my pocket, I'm spendin' it all tonight
                Like a prophet with the vision, I finally see the light
                And you know
                I've been dreamin' 'bout the West Coast (I've been dreamin')
                Found some faces that I don't know (I've been dreamin' about it)
                I'm seein' signs for California
                Trade the shade for somethin' warmer
                I've been dreamin' 'bout the West Coast (I've been dreamin')
                Where the people take it real slow (I've been dreamin' about it)
                I need the sun for just a year
                I'll kiss the sky and disappear, the West Coast
                Glitter nights under starry skies
                All I wanna do is fly
                Take me where the sun shines brighter
                I've been dreamin' 'bout the West Coast
                Time to find myself a new glow
                I need the sun for just a year
                I'll kiss the sky and disappear
                I've been dreamin' 'bout the West Coast (I've been dreamin')
                Found some faces that I don't know (I've been dreamin' about it)
                I'm seein' signs for California
                Trade the shade for somethin' warmer
                I've been dreamin' 'bout the West Coast (I've been dreamin')
                Where the people take it real slow (I've been dreamin' about it)
                I need the sun for just a year
                I'll kiss the sky and disappear
